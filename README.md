# Algorithm Visualizer

A React Application that visualizes the five commonly used sorting algorithms - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort. Includes a sort speed selector with five different speeds: Very Fast, Fast, Normal, Slow, and Sloth.

## Sorting Algorithms
The Algorithm Visualizer contains the following sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. Selection Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that divides the input into two parts: the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the end of the sorted part.

3. Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the input in half, sorts each half and then merges the two sorted halves to produce a single sorted output.

4. Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element from the input and rearranges the other elements such that all elements smaller than the pivot come before it and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. It then repeats this process on the two halves.

5. Heap Sort: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that converts the input into a binary max-heap, a complete binary tree where the parent node is always greater than or equal to its children, and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and swaps it with the last element in the heap until the heap is empty.

## How to run the code locally
